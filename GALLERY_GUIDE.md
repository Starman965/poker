# Gallery Feature Guide

## Overview

The Gallery feature allows you to share photos from poker nights with all members. It uses Firebase Storage for hosting images and Firebase Realtime Database for metadata.

## How It Works

### For Members (Public View)

**Gallery Page** - Accessible from the left navigation menu (üì∏ Gallery)

**What Members See:**
- Grid of all uploaded photos
- Album name and upload date on hover
- Click any photo to view full-size in a lightbox/modal
- Sorted by newest photos first
- Lazy loading for performance (images load as you scroll)

**Current Status:**
- Shows placeholder text: "Gallery coming soon! Photos will be added here."
- This will automatically update once admins upload photos

---

## For Admins

### Admin Gallery Management

**Location:** Admin section ‚Üí "Manage Gallery"

### Uploading Photos

**Steps:**
1. Click "Manage Gallery" in admin navigation
2. Enter an **Album Name** (e.g., "January 2025 Game", "Annual Championship 2025")
3. Click **"Select Photos"** to choose one or multiple image files
4. Click **"Upload Photos"** button
5. Watch the live progress indicator showing upload status
6. Wait for "Upload Complete!" confirmation

**Large Batch Uploads (100+ photos):**
- **Yes, you can upload 118 photos at once!**
- System automatically warns when uploading >50 photos
- Live progress bar shows: "X of Y" photos uploaded
- Uploads happen sequentially (one at a time for reliability)
- Estimated time: ~2-5 seconds per photo (depends on file size and connection)
- For 118 photos: expect 4-10 minutes total
- If upload fails partway through, already uploaded photos remain saved
- Progress indicator is fixed in top-right corner during upload

**Technical Details:**
- Supports unlimited multiple file uploads
- Images are uploaded to Firebase Storage (`gallery/` folder)
- Each photo gets a unique timestamp + random suffix filename
- Sequential upload (not parallel) ensures reliability
- Visual progress bar updates in real-time
- Error handling: shows how many uploaded before failure
- Metadata saved includes:
  - Download URL
  - Album name
  - Upload timestamp
  - Uploader's email
  - Storage path
  - Original filename

### Managing Photos

**Admin Gallery View Shows:**
- All uploaded photos in a grid
- Album name and date on each photo
- **Delete button** on each photo (hover to see)
- Ability to remove photos you no longer want displayed

**Delete Photo Function:**
1. Hover over any photo in the admin gallery view
2. Click the red "Delete" button
3. Photo will be removed from:
   - Firebase Storage (the actual image file)
   - Firebase Realtime Database (the metadata)
4. Gallery refreshes automatically

## Usage Tips

### For Best Results:

**Album Naming:**
- Use descriptive names: "March 2025 Championship"
- Include date/month for easy reference
- Be consistent with naming conventions

**Photo Selection:**
- Upload high-quality images
- Group photos by event for better organization
- Consider privacy - get permission before uploading photos with faces

**Performance:**
- Don't upload extremely large files (Firebase has limits)
- Modern phones take high-res photos, but web display doesn't need full resolution
- Consider resizing large images before upload

**Large Batch Upload Tips (100+ photos):**
1. **Stable Connection**: Use WiFi, not cellular data
2. **Keep Browser Open**: Don't close the tab or navigate away during upload
3. **One Album at a Time**: Don't try to upload multiple batches simultaneously
4. **Watch Progress**: The progress indicator will show you exactly where you are
5. **If It Fails**: Already uploaded photos are saved, just retry with remaining photos
6. **Time Management**: For 118 photos, plan for ~5-10 minutes
7. **Don't Refresh**: Let the process complete naturally
8. **Browser Console**: If issues arise, open browser console (F12) to see detailed errors
