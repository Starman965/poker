   ```

## pokersitev2 is Now Standalone! 🎉

Your new site is **completely independent** and ready to replace the legacy site:
- No external dependencies
- All assets self-contained
- Ready for deployment to any web host
- Custom domain configured (danvillepokergroup.com)

## Safe to Delete (After Deployment Verified)

Once you've tested the new site and confirmed everything works:
- poker_legacy/ folder can be archived or deleted
- Keep the database export (poker-a2e1c-default-rtdb-export.json) as backup
