# Migration from Legacy Site

This document outlines what was migrated from `poker_legacy` to `pokersitev2` for standalone deployment.

## Assets Migrated ✅

### Images
All images are now located in `assets/images/`:

1. **Logo**: `dpg.png` - Main DPG logo used in navigation and home page
2. **Favicons**: 
   - `favicon-32x32.png` - Browser tab icon
   - `favicon.ico` - Browser icon fallback

   - jeff.png, jerry.png, jim.png, mark.png, nasser.png
   - rob.png, russell.png, tim.png

### Configuration Files
1. **CNAME** - Custom domain configuration for GitHub Pages (danvillepokergroup.com)
2. **firebase-config.js** - Already existed in pokersitev2

## Code Updates ✅

All file references were updated from `../poker_legacy/` to `assets/images/`:

1. **index.html** (3 references)
   - Favicon link in `<head>`
   - Logo in navigation
   - Logo on home page

2. **app.js** (1 reference)
   - Member photo display in RSVP functionality

3. **vote.html** (3 references)
   - Favicon link
   - Logo display
   - Member photo in voting interface

4. **Documentation** (README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)
   - Updated asset path references
   - Removed legacy folder dependencies

## What Was NOT Migrated

The following legacy files were **not needed** for the new site:

### Legacy HTML Pages (Replaced by Modern SPA)
- app.html, attendance.html, confirmation.html
- delete_login.html, login.html, rsvp.html
- scheduled.html, streak.html, vote.html (legacy version)
- votebox.html, index.html

### Legacy JavaScript (Replaced by Modern Code)
- script.js, vote.js, votebox.js, api.send-sms.js

### Legacy Styles (Replaced by Modern CSS)
- styles.css, login_styles.css

### Other Legacy Files
- thumbsup.png, thumbsdown.png (not used in new design)
- poker-a2e1c-default-rtdb-export.json (database backup, keep in legacy folder)
- status/ folder (not needed)
- README.md (legacy documentation)

## Deployment Readiness ✅

The `pokersitev2` folder is now **completely standalone** and ready for deployment:

- ✅ All assets are self-contained
- ✅ No dependencies on `poker_legacy` folder
- ✅ CNAME file ready for custom domain
- ✅ Firebase configuration in place
- ✅ All file paths updated and verified

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Test Locally**: Open `index.html` in a browser to verify all images load correctly
2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: 
   - Push `pokersitev2` folder to your repository
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - CNAME will automatically configure your custom domain
3. **Update DNS**: Ensure danvillepokergroup.com points to GitHub Pages
4. **Archive Legacy**: Once confirmed working, you can archive or delete the `poker_legacy` folder

## Firebase Data

Your Firebase Realtime Database already contains all the data:
- Members
- Events/Schedule
- RSVPs
- Polls
- Gallery (placeholder for future photos)

No database migration needed - the new site connects to the same Firebase instance.
